* [RegEx](https://regexr.com) - The web tool to create and test your regular expressions


## Sources Used

* [Youtube](https://youtu.be/rhzKDrUiJVk?si=AGID3fVvzAuZQIUu) - The place where I learn how to do the expression


## Expression

* First Name:/^[a-zA-Z]+(?: [a-zA-Z]+)*$/
* Last Name: /^[a-zA-Z'-]+$/ 	
* Gmail: /^[\w.-]+@[\w.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$/
* Password: /^(?=.*[\W])[A-Za-z0-9\W]{12,}$/


## Test case

* First Name: Every test cases pass
* Last Name: Every test cases pass	
* Gmail: Every test cases pass
* Password: Every test cases pass

## Reflection

* Through this activity, I have learn how to do basic RegEx and understand more about website encoding, there was challanges at the beginning when i didn't understand what each key or function does but as time goes on I understand and could put together the correct RegEx. This tool I think is great for universal encoding like password and forms for websites that need it.
